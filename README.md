My endless journey to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science.

What is AI, ML and DS?

1. Starting with the basics
  a) Learning and Recalling Mathematics
      -Linear Algebra  
        Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors 
        Vector and Matrix Norms 
        Special Matrices and Vectors 
        Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors 
        Norms and Eigendecomposition

      -Multivariate Calculus
        Derivatives		
        Basics of Integration		
        Gradients		
        Gradient Visualization		
        Optimization

      -Probability Theory	
        Probability Distributions		
        Expectation, Variance, and Covariance		

      
    b) Python/R Programming
        Learn python programming
        Learn R programming

    c) Implementing for maths in Python and R
        Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors in Python
        Graphing Probability Distributions in R		
        Covariance Matrices in R
 
 To be continued...
